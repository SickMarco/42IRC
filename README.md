### Internet Relay Chat Server in C++

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat system for instant messaging. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

This project is about creating your own IRC server.
You will use an actual IRC client to connect to your server and test it.
Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interact
with each other.
Itâ€™s always a good thing to know.

**Launch the server with:**
```
./ircserv 6667 ktm
```
You can test the server with [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) or enjoy [Konversation](https://konversation.kde.org/) graphical user interface.

>Port: 6667 | Password: ktm
